Zehan Apr 03:

Server can save as many files as u send, name is based 
on Date d = new date.
Proper game and integration.


Alvin Lum:

Gradle build

Adonis:
UI designer

All agreed to hand in a day late for more improvements.

To Run Code, in multiplayer run server, client 1, then client 2
Single player just run after game is over sends score data to server, server writes score to file.
OPEN pokemon folder to see UI had some integration issues earlier with our codes.
 for pokemon folder:
1. Run Server
2. Run Pokemon

Player picks pokemon and then beats 
as many pokemons as possible, then when
they die they will upload their score to server.
